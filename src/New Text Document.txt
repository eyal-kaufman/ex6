General:
-exceptions - make the messages to be "magic numbers", more informative messages -
    (include the problematic data)
    types?
        Variable exception
        unknown line type /
        ???
- docString all the function and classes
handlers:
    Closer "TODO note"
    IfAndWhile : is the deep copy works? throw exceptions in the handler.
            more tests are needed.
    methodHandler: "functionBlock.updateVariable(lineType);" need to update the list of
                function variables, a fix in the variable factory needed.
    VariableHandler: nothing for now?
