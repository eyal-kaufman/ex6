    (include the problematic data)
    types?

        unknown line type /
        ???

oop.ex6.handlers:
    Closer "TODO note"
    IfAndWhile : is the deep copy works? throw oop.ex6.exceptions in the handler.
            more tests are needed.
    methodHandler: "functionBlock.updateVariable(lineType);" need to update the list of
                function oop.ex6.variables, a fix in the variable factory needed.
    VariableHandler: nothing for now?
