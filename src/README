=============================
=          Design           =
=============================

In order to check the validity of Sjava file, the program read the file twice, first time as Strings from a
file, and second time iterating over wrap lines objects the contain the content of a line and its purpose.

At the end of the first reading process, the program would split the lines that are in a global scope
and the ones inside methods, so all the lines related to a global scope will be valid, and all the methods
inside blocks will be stored in a data structure, each of the methods will be stored as Function object that
hold a pool of lines that placed inside their scope.
The first Reading is using bufferReading for iterating over the file, and for each line, it create an object
from it, and store the data from the line for future validation and usage, during process it make some basic
validation tests, like if the line ends with one of the suffix: ";{}" and validate methods' signatures.

After this, the advanced reading method get invoked (named "readFunctionsData"), this method iterates over all
 the methods that exist in the sjava code, and test for validity of the lines objects ("LineType") that stored
  in them, and for each of that it check for validity.


Some of the design principals we use in this program:
Single choice principal - The enum Classes such as Types and FindLineType that contains a lot of logic related
to the types and accepted actions in javas are only there.
Encapsulate - the implementation of ReadFile encapsulate the process of reading and validation of the file.
Open close -  the Sjavac class represents to the client only the main actions occur in this program and
shallow the implementation of it.
Factory - The VariableFactory and Parser classes use the factory design pattern, get input and create some
Objects accordingly.
parser - this was useful when we wanted to know what kind of line we got to.
in parser package we analyzed the different kind of line.
each line we extracted the relevant information for future usage.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================

In order to implement an object represent a scope, we write Block and Function class. the Block class
represent the if/while and global scope, so the Function class is inheritor of Block class, and represent
specifically a method scope. we chose this kind of partition between these scope because the behavior excepted
from a method is different from behavior of the others, in example every method saves LinkedList of its
arguments, and attempt to save those as local variables, this kind of behavior is unique for function.
Another issue of implementation, is that we created some static variable in ReadFile that used for counting
the closer blocks, for storing all the method sections encounter while iterate the file and more.

In order to parse the sjava code, we use Enum class named FundLineType, this line use REGEX to determinate
which action this line related to. if it none is found, then it would throw an exception.

For understanding if casting or declaration of a variable is valid or not, related to type issues,
the program use the Enum class named Types, this class hold all the logic related to Types in sjava, such as
which type accept the other, what are the types in sjava, and more.

=============================
=    Answers to questions   =
=============================

Error Handing 6.1:
Anytime an error or a syntax issue occur, it would throw an exception with an informative message of the
problem. Every package has it own exceptions sub package, and in every one of them has a super class that all
the other classes in the sub package are inherited from, so when attempting to catch an exception in the main
package it would try to catch only the higher hierarchy of exception classes


How would you modify your code to add new method types (e.g., float)?
add any modifier to the enum class named Types, as we wish.
add to the new modifier added the appropriate Pattern and a string of the new name type, and the appropriate
logic needed.


–which modifications/extensions you would have to make in your code
 in order to support Different methods’ types (i.e int foo()):

we would add a new modifier to enum Types,
in the enum FindLineType we will add to the regex any one of the Type options.
will add another field to the Functions class, that holds the return type wanted.
and when we check if the signature statement is valid, we will add the type to the new field we added.
and each time we hit a return statement (in ExecuteLine) we will add another ultimatum,
checking that the the type being returned matches the signature return type.


- which modifications/extensions you would have to make in your code
in order to support classes?

the way we check the program now is as we are checking one class only.
to support a file that has many class all we need to is add an external class that manages all the different
 class.
we will create a data structure that holds an object of class, and each time we reach a new class we checks
 it validity,
meaning it is valid syntax wise.
the we send it to our current program, all the validity tests we have there now are accurate for a class.


this regex is used for determinate a signature of a method:
[\t ]*void[\t ]+\\w.*[\t ]*[(][ \t]*.*[ \t]*[)][\t ]*\\{[\t ]*
In addition to accept zero or more white spaces and tabs in the signature, I used
[ \t]* as separator between every sign, for guarantee the line ends with { I put
this sign at the end, in addition to verify pretenses, I search for:
[(][ \t]*.*[ \t]*[)]
so even no argument in a method would be accept, as long as many white spaces there.

This regex is used for finding the type and modifier of a variable:
[ \t]+\w+$|\w+[ \t]*[,;=]
using the Matcher.find method, the program can split the variable line into two parts,
modifier & type, and the variable name and value (if exists).
in this regex I used or operator to allow 2 options, the first is \w signs ending, specifically for
method arguments, and the second one for normal variable declaration and casting.
